# Create-a-Terraform-project-which-Implements-a-VPC-on-AWS-and-deploys-to-EKS-cluster.
In this Terraform project we will learn how to provisions a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) on AWS, deploys an Amazon Elastic Kubernetes Service (EKS) cluster within that VPC, and provides associated networking and IAM resources. In this I'll create a well-organized Terraform configuration for an AWS VPC and EKS cluster, split into logical modules.
